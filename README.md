# The-Partition-Problem

<p> Problem: Integer Partition without Rearrangement </p> 
<p>Input: An arrangement S of nonnegative numbers {s1,...,sn} and an integer k. </p>
<p> Output: Partition S into k or fewer ranges, to minimize the maximum sum over all the ranges, without reordering any of the numbers. </p>

<p> The problem is taken from The Algorithm Design Manual by Steve Skienna. </p>
